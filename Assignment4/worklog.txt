    program is hanging after printing the the last child.I suspect the children are not execting the while loop sucessfully becuase I am not closing the pipes properly or in the right order. more investigation is required. scanf is still not implemented nor is the merger.

    Started extraction function, currently the function sucessfully locates and compares the argument filename string to the header filename string. Next I need to create a function that create a new file and write its contents.

    finished normal and verbose print out of archive, and and started append function. currently the function converts values from stat function to a string buffer. Now I need to start writting this header along with the file contents to an actual achive file sucessfully. the true test will be if I can write and archive and sucessfully extract it using ar.

    time is now properly displayed using the time tm struct and the strftime function. Permissions are still messed up on the archived files however. I still think my flags are incorrect. On another note, I finally got the while loop to work inside open_file function, I am now checking for a return of 0 on read() to see if I have reached the end of file
