INTRODUCTION

Daudet once remarked that England was the last of foreign countries to
welcome his novels and that he was surprised at the fact since for
him as for the typical Englishman the intimacy of home life had great
significance However long he may have taken to win Anglo Saxon hearts
there is no question that he finally won them more completely than any
other contemporary French novelist was able to do and that when but
a few years since the news came that death had released him from his
sufferings thousands of men and women both in England and in America
felt that they had lost a real friend Just at the present moment one
does not hear or read a great deal about him but a similar lull in
criticism follows the deaths of most celebrities of whatever kind and
it can scarcely be doubted that Daudet is every day making new friends
while it is as sure as anything of the sort can be that it is death not
estrangement that has lessened the number of his former admirers sassy sally
